### Chapter 8 - Calling Backend-Services (Part-2)

I have completed part-2 of chapter 8 (Calling Backend-Services) and i have added real time backend in previously created "vidly" project using REST API that is already created by mosh. In this project i have implemented crud operations on movies page , notifications using "react-toastify" package.

#### Url of node-api project created by mosh is :https://github.com/mosh-hamedani/vidly-api-node

I have learned following things from this exercise .
